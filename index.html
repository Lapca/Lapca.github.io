        <p>
            My whole life I've been interested in too many things, <br>
            one of my highschool teachers used to tell me: <br>
            "Martin, Martin, you can't sit on two chairs with one ass!"
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't care. <br>
            I'd skip school to attend a futsal training, <br>
            run to school for maths olympiad, <br>
            eat lunch, attend a class or two, <br>
            run to a football match. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Evening? <br>
            My friend is a pro League of Legends player, why can't I? <br>
            Homework? Duh. I'll use the breaks between classes! <br>
            Exam? Breaks! <br>
            Talking to friends? Breaks! <br>
            Somehow I always got away with it. <br>
            Well, until I didn't. <br>
            Or did I not?

            All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions,
            such as reading data, writing data, jumping to addresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. 
            (The complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is know as that...)
